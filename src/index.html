        CSS is a rule-based language - you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular 
        elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as 
        large red text."
      </p>
      <p>
        The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:
          <pre><code>h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
  }</code></pre>
      </p>

      <article>
      <p>
        As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll 
        ee reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a 
        particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module 
        to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. You will also 
        find links to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see below).
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to 
        find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar 
        things and are therefore probably in the same specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module - you might think that it makes 
        logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.

      <p>
        So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the 
        elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will 
        need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common way to do 
        this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.
      </p>
      <p>
        In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this: 
        
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li <strong>class="special"</strong>&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. 
        Add the following to your CSS file:
        <pre><code>.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
  }
        </code></pre>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>External stylesheet</li>
        <li>Internal stylesheet</li>
        <li>Inline styles</li>
      <p>
        An external stylesheet is when you have your CSS written in a separate file with a .css extension, and you reference 
        it from an HTML <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element.
      </p>
      <p>
        An internal stylesheet is where you don't have an external CSS file, but instead place your CSS inside a 
        "style" element contained inside the HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect one element only, contained within a style attribute.

  <section class="main-section" id="Selectors">
    <header>Selectors</header>
      <article>
      <p>
        You can't talk about CSS without meeting selectors, and we have already discovered several different types in 
        the Getting started with CSS tutorial. A selector is how we target something in our HTML document in order 
        to apply styles to it. If your styles are not applying then it is likely that your selector does not match 
        the thing you think it should match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each CSS rule starts with a selector or a list of selectors in order to tell the browser which element or 
        elements the rules should apply to. All of the following are examples of valid selectors, or lists of selectors.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Properties_and_values">
    <header>Properties and values</header>
      <article>
      <p>
        At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Properties</b>: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g. font-size, width, background-color) you want to change.</li>
            <li><b>Values</b>: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g. what you want to change the font, width or background color to.)</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. The CSS engine calculates 
        which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style it. 
        What is important to remember is that both properties and values are case-sensitive in CSS. The property 
        and value in each pair is separated by a colon (:).
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
    <header>Functions</header>
      <article>
      <p>
        While most values are relatively simple keywords or numeric values, there are some possible values which take 
        the form of a function. An example would be the calc() function. This function allows you to do simple math from 
        within your CSS, for example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <div class="outer"><div class="box">The inner box is 90% - 30px.</div></div>

          <pre><code>.outer {
  border: 5px solid black;
  }

.box {
  padding: 10px;
  width: calc(90% - 30px);
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
  color: white;
  }
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        A function consists of the function name, and then some brackets into which the allowed values for that function 
        are placed. In the case of the calc() example above I am asking for the width of this box to be 90% of the 
        containing block width, minus 30 pixels. This isn't something I can calculate ahead of time and just enter the 
        value into the CSS, as I don't know what 90% will be. As with all values, the relevant page on MDN will have 
        usage examples so you can see how the function works.

        Some properties like 
        <ul>
          <li>font</li>
          <li>background</li>
          <li>padding</li>
          <li>border</li>
          <li>margin</li>
        </ul>
        are called shorthand properties - this is because they allow you to set several property values in a single line, 
        saving time and making your code neater in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        We won't attempt to teach these exhaustively now - you'll come across many examples later on in the course, and 
        you are advised to look up the shorthand property names in our CSS reference to find out more.

    <header>Conflicting rules</header>
      <article>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and that first word cascading is incredibly important to understand - the 
        way that the cascade behaves is key to understanding CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cascade, and the closely-related concept of specificity, are mechanisms that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict:
        <ul>
          <li>The cascade</li>
          <li>Specificity</li>
          <li>Inheritance</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>CSS provides four special universal property values for controlling inheritance. Every CSS property accepts these values.
        <ul>
          <li>inherit</li>
          <li>initial</li>
          <li>unset</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We now understand why a paragraph nested deep in the structure of your HTML is the same color as the CSS applied to the 
        body, and from the introductory lessons we have an understanding of how to change the CSS applied to something at any 
        point in the document — whether by assigning CSS to an element or creating a class. We will now take a proper look at 
        how the cascade defines which CSS rules apply when more than one thing could style an element.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three factors to consider, listed here in decreasing order of importance. Earlier ones overrule later ones:
        <ul>
          <li>Importance</li>
          <li>Specificity</li>
          <li>Source order</li>
        </ul>
